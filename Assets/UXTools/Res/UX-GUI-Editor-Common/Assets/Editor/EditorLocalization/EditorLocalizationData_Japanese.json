We will collect and use the following information about you:\n• Information we collect about you. We automatically collect certain data from you when you use the Service, including your IP address and device information (such as device type, network data, operating system) and information regarding your use of and interaction with the Service, such as date and time stamps of actions. We also collect and store your data each time you interact with us, for example, when you use in-app support to communicate with us.\n\nChildren\nOur Service is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe that we have unintentionally collected your children’s personal information, you may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at ThunderFireUXTool@service.netease.com. In some cases, we may ask the user to provide us with their date of birth date for age verification. If such information indicates the user is under the age stipulated by the applicable laws and deemed as child under such laws, we will not collect further personal information from the child until a parent/guardian’s verifiable consent is obtained.\nIf you are in the United States:\nWith parental consent, we may collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If we learn that we have collected or received personal information from a child under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent, we shall immediately take the necessary steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our system’s database. Parents have the right to review their child’s personal information; to have their child’s personal information deleted; and to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their child’s personal information by notifying us. As a parent, you understand that NetEase has a legitimate interest in providing your child’s personal information collected via the Service to external providers for the purpose of administering or providing the Service. Anyone under the age of thirteen (13) must seek and obtain parent or guardian permission to use our Service.

Use of Device Information is necessary to perform our contract with you to provide the Service.\n\nHow We Store and Share Your Personal Information\nIn order to perform our contract with you, your personal information will be accessible from and will be processed on our servers. Our servers are hosted on cloud servers such as Amazon Web Services. Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries outside the country you are located. We will take steps necessary to comply with applicable legal requirements, such as using European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses to protect your information. In particular, your information will be transferred to and processed in Japan where our central database is based.\nWe share your personal information with selected third parties in and outside your country, including:\n• third-party vendors that provide services in support of the Service, such as Microsoft Azure for the purpose of hosting the service. Those third party vendors have limited access to your personal information and are contractually bound not use it for other purposes.\n• related group companies, with whom we share your information to operate the Service. The transfers contemplated above are made pursuant to our contract with you; and\n• law enforcement agencies, public authorities or other judicial bodies and organizations. We disclose information if we are legally required to do so, or if we have a good faith belief that such use is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with a legal obligation, process or request; (ii) enforce our terms of service and other agreements, policies, and standards, including investigation of any potential violation thereof; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; or (iv) protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users, a third party or the public as required or permitted by law (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection).\n\n\nThe Security of Your Personal Information\nWe are committed to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your personal information no matter where it is stored. We have information security and access policies that limit access to our systems and technology. We deploy a firewall and other security measures (such as encryption) commensurate to industry standards to prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. Your personal information will remain subject to our technical and organizational controls and our policies and procedures (including this Privacy Policy). Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted to our services; any transmission of your information is at your own risk.\n\n\nData Retention\nWe will retain most of your personal information for the lifetime of your use of the Service (i.e. until account deletion in accordance with your request) except that Contact Information obtained from promotional activities will be retained during the lifetime of such activities.\nIn the event that the processing and retention period have terminated, but personal information is required to be retained continuously for other reasons including for the purposes as prescribed under applicable laws, the relevant personal information will be stored and maintained separately from other types of personal information. If you require us to destroy your personal information before the end of its life cycle, we will destroy your personal information in accordance with local laws.\n\n\nYour Rights\nThis section (“Your Rights”) applies to users that are located in the European Economic Area only. For California Residents, please refer to https://www.neteasegames.com/privacy/02.html. For users located in other territories, please refer to the privacy clauses in our User Agreement.\nYou have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as set out in more detail below). We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (though this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at ThunderFireUXTool@service.netease.com. Please understand further information may be required to verify your identity when exercising your rights.\nAccess\nYou have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with.

You have the right to receive this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party.\nIf you wish for us to transfer such personal information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party in your request. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g., where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).\nCorrection\nYou have the right to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate.
